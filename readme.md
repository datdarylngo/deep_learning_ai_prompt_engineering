This course on ChatGPT prompt engineering for developers is led by Isa Fulford, a member of OpenAI's technical staff. The course focuses on using API calls to large language models (LLMs) for building software applications, covering prompting best practices, common use cases, and chatbot building with LLMs.

There are two types of LLMs: base LLMs and instruction-tuned LLMs. Base LLMs predict the next word based on text training data, while instruction-tuned LLMs are trained to follow instructions. Instruction-tuned LLMs are more useful and safer for practical applications, so the course focuses on best practices for these models.

When using instruction-tuned LLMs, it's important to provide clear instructions, as if you were speaking to a smart individual who isn't familiar with your specific task. Being specific about the content and tone of the desired output can help achieve better results. The course will cover more principles and best practices in the following videos.
